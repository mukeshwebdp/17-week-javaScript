# 1. Write a function called "addNumbers" that take two numners as arguments and returns their sum. Call the functon before before it is declared to demonstrate hoisting.

# 2. Write a function called "mutiplyNumbers" that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product. Use function expressions to define the function and call the functon before it is declared to demonstrate hoisting.

# 3. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Declare a variable inside the function using the var keyword and log its value to the console before it is assigned a value to demonstrate variable hoisting.

# 4. Declare three variables, one using let, one using const, all block scope. Assign them values and log their values to the console before and after they are declared to demon

# 5. Declare a variable using let inside a block scope and attempt to log its value to the consloe before it is assigned a value to demonstrate the temporal dead zone.
